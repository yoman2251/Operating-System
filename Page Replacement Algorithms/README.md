First, generate a random page-reference string where page numbers range from 0 to 9.<br>
Apply the random page-reference string to each algorithm, and record the number of page faults incurred by each algorithm.<br>
Implement the replacement algorithm so that the number of page frames can vary from 1 to 7.<br>
Assume that demand paging is used.<br>
